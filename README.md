# Game Theory and OPEC Project

Authored by David Wittsack and Chris Pocetti 

## Description 
Welcome to our Game Theory project that explores the game that arises when OPEC members choose to either cooperate with or defect from proposed oil production cuts. This application is written using html, javascript and css. A live version of the project can be viewed on https://dwittty.github.io/ and it should run correctly in all modern browsers. 

## How To Run the Code
To run the code locally on your machine, navigate to the root directory of the project using your preferred shell with access to a python installation (I'm using Anaconda Prompt) and run the following command: 

python -m http.server

This should yield a result that looks something like this: 

(base) C:\Users\YourPathToTheDirectory\HoldingTheCode> python -m http.server
Serving HTTP on :: port 8000 (http://[::]:8000/) ...

In your browser, navigate to localhost using the specified port (in this example it is 8000)

http://localhost:8000/

You should now have a local copy of the code running in your browser.
